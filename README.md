Project Management
Importance of Gantt Charts
Get to know the benefits of Gantt charts in project management and how it is useful for project managers.

Consider how tough it is to balance multiple balls at the same time. If you miss a ball, the entire act is thrown out. Project management is a lot like juggling, in that you're continuously juggling between many tasks, people, projects, and other things. When a deadline is missed, the entire planning process might go awry, with catastrophic consequences.

This is why having a visual picture of a project schedule and knowing when each task is completed and who is working on it is beneficial. And it is here that Gantt chart software comes into play.

Gantt charts are visual representations of tasks plotted against time. They represent crucial information in a project, such as who is assigned to what, task durations, and overlapping activities. A Gantt chart depicts the completion of each work in a project using timelines. These timelines explain how the various tasks are connected. Gantt charts are useful because they show the activities and progress of a project.

Gantt charts show how work on a project can only begin after another task has been completed. Managers can use this data to better understand project obstacles and make key decisions about how to take a project ahead.
